                    when it was named the 'Tea Set' (T-Set). He became known 
                    for his English-accented singing and consciousness writing. 
                    Syd Barrett recorded several single debut albums: <em>The Piper at the 
                    Gates of Dawn</em> (1967), <em>A Saucerful of Secrets</em> (1968) and other 
                    unreleased ones. Pink Floyd tributed the songs "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" (1975) and 
                    "The Wall" (1979) to Syd Barrett after his retirement from the band in 1972.

                    of Pink Floyd. He was born on 28 July, 1943 in Hatch End, Middlesex. He learned guitar, 
                    trombone, trumpet and piano at the age of 12 all by himself. Wright's mother asked him to 
                    focus on piano, as a result, he started taking piano lessons. Richard Wright met 
                    Roger Waters and Nick Mason while studying architecture in University of Westminister.

                    the music business and moved to Greece because he had a fascination about greek 
                    islands and sailing.

                    before the Pink Floyd was established and left before it formatted. He left the band because he was more 
                    serious about his studies than the band, he wanted to focus more in his academic career.
                    Later in 1960's he abandoned his studies and started photography parmanently. Richard

                    problems; as a result he had to leave the band.
