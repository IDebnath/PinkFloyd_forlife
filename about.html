            <p> I have created a 5 page website about a British
                progressive rock band Pink Floyd. In this website, 
                I have used web programming languages such as HTML, CSS,
                and Javascript. All the pages are linked to each other which
                are commanded to open in a new tab for user's convenience. In the Biography
                section I have attached a brief description about the life 
                history and achievements of each band member. There is also a short description
                about the band in the home page. I have also attached their 
                discography and tour dates in separate pages.
